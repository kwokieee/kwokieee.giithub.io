## Welcome to the code repository for my personal page

This website is currently a work in progress.

This webpage uses the React framework with Vite as a build tool, together with Tailwind CSS. To run it locally,

1. Install all dependencies by running `yarn install`.
2. Run `yarn preview` to start the dev server.
