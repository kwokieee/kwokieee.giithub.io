      <p className="text-left mb-4 text-sm sm:text-base">In the first half of 2022, I had the opportunity to work with ST Engineering under the Digital Facilities Solutions department, which was in charge of developing the AGIL Smart City Operating System, or cityOS for short.</p>
      <p className="text-left text-sm sm:text-base">cityOS is a platform for integrating and managing key assets of buildings, estates, and cities as a whole to enhance efficiency and save costs. This was my first real software development internship, and I was given the opportunity to try my hand at many tasks related to infrastructure, DevOps, 3D modelling, and full stack development.</p>

      <p className="text-left mb-4 text-sm sm:text-base">In the infrastructure/DevOps team, I created an automated help desk to provide a smoother onboarding process for new employees and administrators, and assisted in deploying Keycloak as part of the department's cloud migration efforts.</p>
      <p className="text-left mb-4 text-sm sm:text-base">I was also tasked with using 3D modelling software like Blender to create a to-scale model of some of the company's office buildings, as well as model certain assets to be monitored by the cityOS application (e.g. Elevators, EV chargers, smart air-cooling units).</p>
