      <p>Duration: Jan - Jul 2022 (7 months)</p>
      <p className="text-left">In the first half of 2022, I had the opportunity to work with ST Engineering under the Digital Facilities Solutions department, which was in charge of developing the AGIL Smart City Operating System, or cityOS for short. cityOS is a platform for integrating and managing key assets of buildings, estates, and cities as a whole to enhance efficiency and save costs. This was my first real software development internship, and I was given the opportunity to try my hand at many tasks such as DevOps, 3D modelling, and full stack development.</p>

      </div>
      <p className="text-start">In the DevOps team, I created an automated help desk to provide a smoother onboarding process for new employees and administrators, and assisted in deploying Keycloak as part of the department's cloud migration efforts.</p>
      <p className="text-left">I was also tasked with using 3D modelling software like Blender to create a to-scale model of some of the company's office buildings, as well as model certain assets to be monitored by the cityOS application (e.g. Elevators, EV chargers, smart air-cooling units)</p>

      </div>
      <p className="text-left">In addition, I also assisted the development team in bug fixes, data preparation, as well as developing the "Preventive Maintenance" feature with a group of overseas developers from China.</p>
      <p className="text-left">The work was tough, but it was my first taste of developing a real world product, and I was blessed to have such friendly and patient teammates to guide me through my journey.</p>
